Logic-for-Beginners: Modular Logic Kit

An affordable, user-friendly, and open-source system designed to help students explore the world of digital logic through hands-on experimentation.

The Vision

Understanding logic gates is the foundation of computer science, yet learning it from a textbook can be abstract. Our goal is to make logic tangible. This kit allows students to physically connect gates, visualize signal flows in real-time, and build complex circuits from simple building blocks.
🛠 Project Overview

The system consists of uniform, modular Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) categorized into three functional classes:
1. INPUT Modules

    Function: Generates logical signals (High/Low).

    Control: Dual outputs per board, controlled via tactile slide switches.

    Power: A specialized version includes USB-C Power Delivery to power the entire chain.

    Feedback: Integrated LEDs to show the current state of each output.

2. LOGIC GATES

    Types: AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR.

    Visualization: Every input and output has a dedicated LED, making the signal flow easy to trace.

    Educational Design: Each board is clearly labeled with standardized logic gate symbols.

3. OUTPUT Modules

    Function: Visualizes the final result of a logic chain.

    Display: Dual LED indicators to represent the final states.

    Expansion: Future versions will feature a display for Binary-to-Decimal/Hexadecimal conversion.

Modular Design & Hardware

    Interconnectivity: Boards are designed to be plugged together seamlessly.

    3D-Printed Connectors: To ensure a robust physical connection, we have developed custom-fit 3D-printed mechanical bridges.

    Form Factor: All PCBs share a standardized footprint for easy storage and assembly.

Getting Started

    Conceptual Design: Check out our General Concept File for a deep dive into the architecture.

    PCB Designs: Schematic and layout files are located in the /hardware folder (designed in KiCad).

    Assembly: View the 3D-printing files in /mechanics for the connector bridges.
